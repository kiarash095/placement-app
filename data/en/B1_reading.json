She applied for a teaching job in Toronto, got accepted, and began preparing for the big move. \n\nAt first, everything was exciting — the idea of living in a new country, meeting new people, and learning about a different culture. But once she arrived, things were more difficult than she expected. She didn’t know anyone, the weather was colder than she was used to, and she missed her family. \n\nEmma started to feel homesick, and there were moments when she wondered if she had made a mistake. However, she reminded herself why she came — to challenge herself, grow, and experience life in a new way. \n\nGradually, things got better. She made friends at work, joined a local hiking group, and even started taking French classes. One year later, Emma says moving to Canada was one of the hardest — but also the best — decisions she has ever made.",
